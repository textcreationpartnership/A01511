            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the ſunne ſhine in its full brightneſſe, yet if either the eye be defective, or the medium unfit, or the object too remote, we ſee but imperfectly: So though truth be moſt reſplendent in it ſelf, yet if either we be uncapable in apprehending, or tho means unapt to convey, or the truth to be known too farre diſtant either in place or time, it ſeems not to be ſuch to us as it is indeed in it own nature. The God of truth, willing to acquaint us with that truth which it moſt concerns us to know, hath provided his Spirit to enlighten our underſtanding; his Sonne and miniſtery, the means to convey it; and his written word, to bring thoſe things which were done many ages before our time, and in places farre diſtant from us,<note place="margin">Galat. 3.1.</note> ſo neare, as if we had ſeen them acted before our eyes. To this end our Saviour Chriſt did chooſe from among the Jews certain men,<note place="margin">Luke 1.2.</note> which had known his life and doctrine from the beginning, to be witneſſes thereof, to the Jews and Gentiles; and ſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted two from among his apoſtles, and from his diſciples other two, to commit them to writing,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.6. and 19.15.</note> and tranſmit them to poſteritie: That if in other caſes the witneſſe of two or three were ſufficient, this of foure might abundantly ſatisfie any that ſhould doubt of that truth, which in times paſt did ſhine full bright among the Jews. Eſpecially having received what they deliver, not onely by their own knowledge and experience;<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.21.</note> but writing, as they ſpake, the dictates of the Spirit of God. The writings therefore of one of theſe whom we call Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.</note> being the testimonie of the holy Spirit (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) is of more value, and ought rather to be credited, then the teſtimonie of many, nay, of all men: but all of them agreeing in one and the ſame truth, their teſtimonie is ſo much the more enforcing, as implying ſo many ſeverall acts of one and the ſame Spirit, producing in divers ſubjects one and the ſame effect, even <hi>The myſterie of our Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For though every one of them follow his own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb facs="tcp:3053:4"/>method and order in the context of his hiſtorie, and ſometimes deliver the ſame thing in the ſame or other words, or adde ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to that which another had written, or new matter altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omitted by the rest, and now and then ſeem not ſo much to reſpect order and method, as faithfully to record things done: yet in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth both of Chriſts ſpeeches and actions, there is admirable conſent and celeſtiall harmonie.</p>
            <p>For the more cleare demonſtration of this, the learned (from the very primitive times through all ages to this of ours) have beſtowed much labour and extraordinarie induſtrie in comparing of their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies together: as, <hi>Tatianus</hi> the ſcholar of <hi>Juſtin Martyr; Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monius, Origens</hi> maſter; <hi>Theophilus, Antiochenus, Epiphanius</hi> contra Alogos, <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in his foure books of the conſent of the Evangeliſts: After them, <hi>Petrus Comeſtor, Bonaventura, Ludolphus de Saxonia, Joannes Gerſon:</hi> And of late, <hi>Andreas Oſiander, Codomannus, Molineus, Janſenius, Barrhadius, Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Selmatterus,</hi> and many others: by whoſe labours in that kinde the Church of God hath been much enlightned and adorned. Yet this, as it was performed by ſeverall men, ſo was it done in a diverſe manner. Some of them reduced all the foure Evangeliſts into the method &amp; text of one: the manner whereof appeares by thoſe Canons yet remaining &amp; extant in <hi>S. Hierome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tom. 6. <hi>in initio.</hi>
               </note> Others placed the ſeverall texts collaterally in one page; leaving it to the reader to judge, what was added, or delivered otherwiſe by any one of them. And this order the moſt of later times have followed, <hi>Calvin</hi> excepted, who harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizeth onely the three firſt, placing <hi>S. John</hi> by himſelf, as hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to the other three. Others again have reduced all the foure into one continued context, bringing in every one in his due place and own words, delivering his part of the hiſtorie of Chriſt. Of this ſort, among the Romane Catholicks, <hi>Janſenius;</hi> among the Catholick Proteſtants, that incomparable Divine <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Chemnitius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Helvic. <hi>chron.</hi>
               </note> who departing this life in the yeare <hi>1588,</hi> when he had onely finiſhed the two firſt books, it was continued by <hi>Lyſerus:</hi> but he likewiſe lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it unfiniſhed, there was not any found that durſt put his hand to the perfecting of that table of <hi>Apelles;</hi> till after fifteen yeares it was undertaken, and in few yeares made compleat, by the inceſſant labours of the learned and famous <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> John Gerhard</hi> in the yeare <hi>1626.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3053:5"/>Which being ſo exactly performed, and received with ſuch generall applauſe by the beſt; I thought it the moſt fit and moſt worthy to be the rule and ſquare (for order <hi>ratio</hi>

               </gap>) by which I might guide my ſelf in this Harmonie which I have publiſhed: ſome few chapters onely excepted, which they left as indifferent. If any man therefore ſhall require a reaſon of the placing of any part of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, why this or that precedes or follows; I doubt not but if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult what they have written of that particular, he ſhall receive abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſatisfaction. What hath been my part herein, with the reaſon of this new form in which I have placed it, ſhall appeare in the following direction.</p>
            <p>The benefit which will accrue to the intelligent reader by this kinde of harmonie, will be infinitely more then I can acquaint him with. For there is no one word or ſentence of any of the Evangeliſts omitted, nor any redundant in this; but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall and continued connexion of the hiſtorie in their own words: ſave onely ſuch, as in all tranſlations be inſerted to make compleat the ſenſe of the authour. If any phraſe or word did expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the reſt, though it were to the ſame ſenſe, there both be put in. Whence to unforeſtalled judgements theſe things will eaſily appeare:

                     <hi>1.</hi> What ſpeeches or actions of Chriſt go before, what follow and ſucceed.</item>

                  <item>
                     <hi>3.</hi> The circumſtances of any actions omitted by one or two of the Evangeliſts, are in this reduced to their due place, and that hiſtorie perfected.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>4.</hi> Many places of the Evangeliſts, which ſeem to a heedleſſe reader to contradict one another, are by this connexion more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly reconciled, then by any gloſſe whatſoever.</item>
                  <item>

                  <item>
                     <hi>6.</hi> And laſtly, from the whole thus compacted, ariſeth a moſt compleat hiſtorie of our Saviours life and death, with the whole foundation of Evangelicall doctrine: which is not ſo clearely pourtraicted by one, two, or three of the Evangeliſts,
<pb facs="tcp:3053:5"/>as by them all together.

            <p>It is alſo divided from the beginning to the end into 212 chapters,<note place="margin">Chapters.</note> (which diviſions come nearer thoſe of the Greeks, then our own) not beginning to number them again at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of every book; that (if there be occaſion) it might the more eaſily be compared with <hi>Chemnitius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every page in the title,<note place="margin">Pages.</note> ſhews in what yeare every thing was done; and hath its margent divided into foure columnes: every of which doth ſeverally contain the name, chapter, and verſe of every Evangeliſt: that the margent might ſhew in what chapter and verſe every part of the Context is to be found: that the text of any one of them might be viewed; or, where they all ſpeak of the ſame thing, they might (if it be thought requiſite) the more fitly be compared.</p>
            <p>The Romane letters inſerted,<note place="margin">Letters.</note> ſignifie that there begin the words of that Evangeliſt, which continue till the next: <hi rend="sup">M.</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the words of S.

            <p>The Aſterisk referres to places which be like,<note place="margin">Aſterisk.</note> and might ſeem to ſome to be the ſame; though indeed they be not: or if the ſame words, yet uſed at another time, and upon other occaſion.</p>
            <p>The tranſlation which I have followed ſtrictly,<note place="margin">Tranſlation.</note> is the laſt of our own (allowed by authoritie) as being the beſt, and moſt exact. Where we had but one Engliſh word to expreſſe two or more in the Greek; there the Greek is placed in the margent.</p>
            <p>The Table at the end,<note place="margin">Table.</note> ſhews in what chapter of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie any chapter, verſe, or ſentence of any of the Evangeliſts may be found; which being known, it will thence appeare, at what time it was done or ſpoken. And know that <hi>Ch.</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the chapter of the Evangeliſt, and <hi>C. H.</hi> for the chapter of the Harmonie: <hi>As for example,</hi> If you deſire to know in what chapter of the Harmonie, the firſt of Matthew, from the beginning to the end of the 17 verſe, is handled, you ſhall finde it in the third chapter of the Harmonie; and from the beginning of the 18 verſe, to the 25 and laſt verſe, in the 7 chapter of the Harmonie.
